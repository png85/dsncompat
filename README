this small library provides a bunch of non-standard C/C++ functions that are
available on various platforms for targets which don't have them. it is mainly
meant to be used as a submodule from within other  projects to provide a
portable implementation of these functions.

the library's build process is setup so that only the code that isn't present
in the target system's C library gets compiled and the output is a static
library iteself which can be linked into larger projects.
